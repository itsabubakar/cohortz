# Cohortz

Cohortz is a dynamic platform for managing communities and online classes, combining features similar to Circle and Skol. The app allows users to create and manage communities (referred to as "cohortz"), upload and share resources, and follow different cohortz to stay updated with their activities. Whether you're an educator, community leader, or student, Cohortz provides a centralized space to facilitate engagement and learning.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Cohortz**: Users can easily create and customize their own cohortz, defining their focus and objectives.
- **Resource Uploads**: Share valuable resources, such as documents, videos, and links, with your cohortz members.
- **Follow Cohortz**: Stay connected with various cohortz by following them and receiving updates on their activities.
- **Community Engagement**: Engage with members through posts, discussions, and updates.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Built with React Native and Outblic for a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: Utilizes modern backend technologies to handle data management, user authentication, and resource sharing.
